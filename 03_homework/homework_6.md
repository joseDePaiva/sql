**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

**My response**

Reflecting on my previous work with SQL and database manipulation after completing the course, I realize the immense power and responsibility that comes with handling data. SQL, being a powerful tool for managing and querying databases, allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. Throughout the course, I learned various techniques for optimizing queries, designing database schemas, and ensuring data integrity.

However, as I look back on my work, I recognize the importance of incorporating ethics and equity components into data management practices. Data, especially in today's interconnected world, can have significant impacts on individuals, communities, and society as a whole. Without careful consideration, data manipulation can perpetuate biases, reinforce inequities, and even infringe on individuals' privacy rights.

To adjust my approach and include ethics and equity components in my work, I would adopt a few different strategies:

**Data Governance Framework:** Implementing a robust data governance framework that outlines policies, procedures, and standards for ethical data handling. This framework would include guidelines for data collection, usage, sharing, and disposal, ensuring compliance with ethical principles and regulations.

**Privacy Protection:** Prioritizing privacy protection by anonymizing or pseudonymizing sensitive data, limiting access to personally identifiable information, and obtaining informed consent from individuals before collecting or using their data.

**Transparency and Accountability:** Promoting transparency and accountability in data practices by documenting data sources, methodologies, and assumptions. This would enable stakeholders to understand how data is collected, analyzed, and interpreted, fostering trust and accountability.

By integrating these ethics and equity components into my work with SQL and database manipulation, I aim to contribute to more responsible and equitable data practices. In doing so, I hope to leverage the power of data to drive positive change while minimizing harm and promoting fairness for all individuals and communities.
